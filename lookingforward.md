# Looking Forward

-In my future on a pre-medical path, I will put more thought into the data I produce (whether through articles, essays, or projects) and reflect on how to present it in the most impactful way.

-I will continue to take advantage of the resources this class introduced to me including the Kislak Center for research projects, Education Commons for exploring creativity, and attending free workshops on campus to further enrich my knowledge.

-I will also look into taking another digital humanities course, specifically one that highlights discussion of important topics, possibly has overlap with the healthcare world, or one that focuses on the coding and more technical aspects behind digital humanities.
