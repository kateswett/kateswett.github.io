# EC Reflection

The Education Commons project featured an opportunity to work collaboratively on a critical making task, turning data from The Umpire into a physical product. As part of the textiles and textures group, we had the choice of working with embroidery, sewing, screen printing, and more. During the first class at Education Commons, our group explored a variety of ideas, eventually landing on creating a word map depicting relationships between major themes mentioned in The Umpire. Given the opportunity to engage in critical making, we wanted to create a product that would allow us to work with multiple tools. Our goal was to create a physical representation of the connectedness between themes related to community and activities from The Umpire’s perspective. By utilizing the raw dataset, we wanted to create a new way for Eastern State Penitentiary prisoners to be represented as human through their own record of activities and community. 

To help our project come to life, our group started by collaboratively searching through the text and tags columns to find key themes and activities present in The Umpire such as holidays, religion, baseball, riddles, and more. Our digital asset manager, Justin, was able to run the “text” and “tags” columns on The Umpire’s dataset into a word association program that found connections between words and themes based on frequency, how close they were mentioned, and chronology. This was the first concept map created and we next focused on creating future iterations that focused on the activity key themes we had previously brainstormed for easier legibility and to head in a more focused direction.
