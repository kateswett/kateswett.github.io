# EC Reflection

The Education Commons project featured an opportunity to work collaboratively on a critical making task, turning data from The Umpire into a physical product. As part of the textiles and textures group, we had the choice of working with embroidery, sewing, screen printing, and more. During the first class at Education Commons, our group explored a variety of ideas, eventually landing on creating a word map depicting relationships between major themes mentioned in The Umpire. Given the opportunity to engage in critical making, we wanted to create a product that would allow us to work with multiple tools. Our goal was to create a physical representation of the connectedness between themes related to community and activities from The Umpire’s perspective. By utilizing the raw dataset, we wanted to create a new way for Eastern State Penitentiary prisoners to be represented as human through their own record of activities and community. 

To help our project come to life, our group started by collaboratively searching through the text and tags columns to find key themes and activities present in The Umpire such as holidays, religion, baseball, riddles, and more. Our digital asset manager, Justin, was able to run the “text” and “tags” columns on The Umpire’s dataset into a word association program that found connections between words and themes based on frequency, how close they were mentioned, and chronology. This was the first concept map created and we next focused on creating future iterations that focused on the activity key themes we had previously brainstormed for easier legibility and to head in a more focused direction.

A more refined version of the map was then created, placing higher impact concepts towards the middle and connecting to more specific terms on the edges. The initial map’s depictions of chronology and frequency were removed to create a word map based more on how closely different topics/themes were related.

At this point, our group had another meeting to further discuss the project’s direction. Everybody worked with the design facilitator, Alex, to help design a final version of the word map that I would get started on creating. Some issues we had at this point were deciding on which nodes (topics) to keep and which themes seemed most relevant to life in the penitentiary. With further input from members of our group, Alex was able to create an initial draft.

We continued to communicate through our group chat with the help of Jean, our project manager. She made sure we were engaging in discussion and staying on task for creating our product. Since our documentarian Claudia did a good job updating our collaborative google doc with meeting notes and designs, everybody was able to continue adding to the project. Alex further decided to change the arrows connecting topics into lines, a minor detail that contributes greatly to the project as it reflects the bidirectionality of influence between activities within the penitentiary. The same way poetry may influence community, community can have influence on the poetry created. This theme was important to our project because it further represented how within the prison community, there was a connected community full of vibrant clubs and activities that influenced the overall morale and energy of the place.

At this point, I connected with Christine, our point of contact at Education Commons to see the capabilities of printing onto fabric and limitations with color choices and aesthetics. After learning there were no limits to colors used, I worked with Alex further to create a colorized version of our design. Jean and Matthew worked alongside us to add a few more words and fill in any missing connections between topics on our map. The product of these final additions helped create a more visually appealing product and better convey the large extent of connectivity within the penitentiary as depicted through The Umpire.

This is where my role as fabricator came into play as I worked with Christine to help bring our project to life. I uploaded the file onto a thumb drive so Christine could upload the finalized design on Photoshop to put it into an acceptable format for the printer. We then loaded special fabric 8” by 11” sheets into the printer and let it print as usual. The printing process was very simple, the only difference from regular printing was the use of the fabric paper. I then ironed on a backing to the fabric paper in order to prevent any future fraying. Our group had originally thought about machine sewing blue thread on top of the printed lines but due to the thickness of our fabric and limitations of the sewing machine, I decided to hand sew the connections. I used blue embroidery thread to loosely stitch over the printed blue connections. We wanted to implement the thread as it added to the tactile interactivity of our project. By introducing a new texture to the map, users could run their fingers along the connections and be open to deeper reflection on the connections between the prisoners’ activities and themes of community. We thought that by being able to feel the data, the humanness of the prisoners through The Umpire’s data would shine through more effectively.

Our outreach specialist Matthew created slides that thoughtfully presented our intentions and processes of our project. Overall, our group worked very well together and not only did everyone contribute with their roles but everybody continued to communicate and give ideas at every stage of the project. Through my own role as fabricator, I made sure our group’s hard work came to life exactly as envisioned and I spent my own time hand stitching over break to make sure it was perfect. I think our goal of reflecting humanness through The Umpire’ s reflections of activities and communal themes was well met through the word map we created. We used the tools at our disposal in a nuanced way to try and most effectively communicate how interwoven the Eastern State community was, from relations between holidays and religion to sports and competition. If I could go back, the only thing I would change about the project was implementing individual group members’ thoughts on connectivity within the prison reflected through the dataset. I personally felt I had gained a fuller understanding of the ways the prison community functioned and maintained their humanity through activities, especially coming from their own perspective through The Umpire. I think it would’ve been nice to reflect on our project as a whole team, sharing how we each interpreted our final product.
